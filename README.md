# Forest Fire Detection Project

## Overview
The Forest Fire Detection project is a sophisticated deep learning initiative designed to identify and classify instances of forest fires from digital images. Utilizing state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow, the project aims to provide a reliable, automated solution for early forest fire detection, thereby aiding in prompt and effective firefighting efforts.

## Dataset
- **Content**: The dataset comprises a diverse range of images, categorized based on the presence or absence of forest fires.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizing: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input specification of the MobileNetV2 model.
  - Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to facilitate efficient model training.
  - Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping might be applied to increase dataset robustness.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Model**: MobileNetV2 (`mobilenet_v2_100_224`), a lightweight yet effective CNN architecture optimized for mobile and edge devices.
- **Framework**: Implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for model management and deployment.
- **Training**:
  - GPU Acceleration: Utilizes GPU for faster and efficient model training.
  - Transfer Learning: Employing MobileNetV2 pretrained on ImageNet as a feature extractor, with additional layers for fire-specific classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Details about accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated on the test dataset.

## Application Infrastructure (`app.py`)
- **Type**: A Flask-based web application for real-time image processing and fire detection.
- **Features**:
  - Image Upload Interface: Allows users to upload images for fire detection.
  - Real-time Analysis: Rapid classification of images using the trained model.
  - Results Display: Visual and/or textual representation of the model's inference.
